## Blog Post Title From First Header

Motivation: after completion of my Data Science and Decisions degree at UNSW I feel that my skillset is primarily lacking in the area of Industry practices of Data Visualisation. One particularly sought-out skill which will be the main focus of this blog is Tableau. Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that is widely used in various industries to analyze and communicate complex data.

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
